for install bootstrap locally
  npm install --save bootstrap@3

after install bootstrap  we need to add that as dependency of angular.json file styles array

create app with no strict mode
  ng new app-name --no-strict

create component without test file
  ng g c componentName --skipTests true


@Input() used to parent to child data communicate
@Output() used to child to parent data pass

for @Output() we need event to trigger

for complex scenarios we use services to pass data within components

angular has style encapsulate feature that means we can define style for one component
only rather that other places that uses same class or id
