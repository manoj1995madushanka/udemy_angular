  String interpolation {{property}}

The MDN (Mozilla Developer Network) offers nice lists of all
properties and events of the element you're interested in.
Googling for YOUR_ELEMENT properties  or YOUR_ELEMENT events
should yield nice results.


directives are instructions in the DOM
directives are two types
  structural directives : add or remove element to DOM (ng-if)
  attribute directives : they only change element they were placed on (ng-style)

ngStyle allows us to dynamically change css style
ngClass allows us to dynamically add or remove css style

============================================================

In Angular 8+, the @ViewChild() syntax which you'll see in the next lecture needs to be changed slightly:
Instead of:

@ViewChild('serverContentInput') serverContentInput: ElementRef;
use

@ViewChild('serverContentInput', {static: true}) serverContentInput: ElementRef;

The same change (add { static: true } as a second argument) needs to be applied to
 ALL usages of @ViewChild() (and also @ContentChild() which you'll learn about later)
 IF you plan on accessing the selected element inside of ngOnInit().

If you DON'T access the selected element in ngOnInit (but anywhere else in your component),
set static: false instead!

If you're using Angular 9+, you only need to add { static: true } (if needed) but not { static: false }.

===========================================================================================

ngOnInit runs after the constructor

we can use also @ContentChild for @ViewChild
